\section{Introduction}

The goal of this project is to make a free and open source librery that join the most popular algorithms in the reinforcement learning field. The idea is use that algorithms to play computational games.

\section{Actual State}

...

\section{To do}

The followig task are the next features to add at the libreary:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Add many algoritms like:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Sarsa
        \item Deep Q learning
        \item Trust Region Policy optimization
        \item Proximal Policy Optimization
        \item Generative neuronal networks
    \end{itemize}    

    \item Improve MinMax Algorithm with cache and alfa-beta pruning
    \item Add the game naval battle.
    \item Add suport to one player games
    \item Add a conection between grafic interface to model one player games
    \item Expand the documentation
\end{itemize}

\end{document}
